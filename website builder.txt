I can definitely help with that. Since you have a background in Java and want to use Spring AI, I will create a detailed, Jira-style task list to guide you through the project. This will break down the game plan into actionable, smaller steps.

Here is a breakdown of your project into specific tasks:

Project: AI Research Portal
Epic: Phase 1 - Setup and Core Integration
User Story: As a developer, I want to set up the project and integrate the core technologies so I can begin building the main features.

Epic: Phase 2 - Building the Core Functionality
User Story: As a developer, I want to build the main research engine so the application can perform complex research tasks.

Epic: Phase 3 - Building the UI and Frontend
User Story: As a user, I want a clean interface to submit my research topics and view the results.

Epic: Phase 4 - Deployment and Monetization
User Story: As the owner, I want to deploy the application and start earning money.



That's a game-changer! Given your background as an experienced Java developer with knowledge of cloud and UI technologies, using Java is not only possible but the most logical and efficient approach for you. You can leverage your existing expertise to build a robust and scalable application.

Here is a revised game plan specifically tailored to your skill set, with Spring AI as a central component.

The Technology Stack (Leveraging Your Expertise)
Backend Framework: Spring Boot is the ideal choice. It simplifies application development, and its auto-configuration will make setting up your project a breeze.

AI Integration: Spring AI is perfect for your goal. It provides a consistent API for integrating with various large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Google's Gemini, or others. It abstracts the complexity, allowing you to focus on the application logic. You can use it for tasks like summarizing text, extracting key information, and generating structured responses.

Web Scraping: Use a Java library like Jsoup. It's a powerful tool for parsing HTML and extracting data from websites.

Database: You can choose a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB. Spring Data makes it easy to integrate with either, and you can store the research results, user queries, and other data here.

Frontend UI: Since you have UI experience, you can build a modern, dynamic frontend using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. This will communicate with your Spring Boot backend via a REST API.

Revised Game Plan: A Phased Approach
Phase 1: Setup and Core Integration (1-2 Weeks)
This phase is about setting up your basic development environment and getting the core AI and data gathering tools talking to each other.

Project Setup: Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr. Be sure to include dependencies for Spring Web, your chosen database, and the Spring AI starter for your preferred LLM (e.g., spring-ai-openai-spring-boot-starter).

Spring AI Integration: Get your first AI request working. This will be the "Hello World" of your project. Use AiClient to send a simple prompt and receive a response. For example, a simple chat or summarization task.

Web Scraping Test: Write a small, independent Java application using Jsoup to scrape a specific website and extract some text. This proves your data gathering method works.

Phase 2: Building the Core Functionality (2-4 Weeks)
Now, you'll combine the pieces from Phase 1 to build the main engine of your portal.

Create the Research Service: Build a service in your Spring Boot application that combines Jsoup and Spring AI.

The service should take a topic as input.

It should use Jsoup to scrape relevant information from a predefined set of websites.

It should then pass the scraped text to Spring AI with a prompt like: "Summarize the following text and extract key facts and figures: [scraped text]".

Structured Output: Use Spring AI's ability to return a structured response (e.g., a POJO) to make the data easy to work with. For example, you could define a ResearchResult class with fields like title, summary, and keyFacts.

Persist the Data: Store the structured ResearchResult objects in your database. This will prevent redundant scraping and speed up subsequent requests.

Create a REST API: Expose your research functionality through a REST API using Spring's @RestController. This will allow your frontend to communicate with your backend.

Phase 3: Building the UI and User Experience (3-5 Weeks)
This is where you'll build the frontend to make your application user-friendly.

Frontend Setup: Set up your chosen UI framework (React, Angular, etc.) as a separate project.

API Integration: Create a user interface with a search bar and a button. When the user submits a topic, your UI will make a call to your Spring Boot REST API.

Displaying Results: Design a clean and responsive layout to display the research results. You can show the summarized text, key facts, and links to the original sources.

Phase 4: Deployment and Monetization (Ongoing)
Once you have a working product, you can launch it and focus on your primary goal of earning money.

Deployment: Deploy your Spring Boot application and frontend to a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Your experience here will be a major advantage.

Monetization: Implement your chosen strategy from the previous conversation. Google AdSense is the quickest way to start, or you can build a more advanced subscription model for premium features once you have a user base.
